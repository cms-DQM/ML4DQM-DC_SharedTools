# MLNtuplizer

This repository contains the code used to create ntuples for ML4DQM-DC studies.
This is a second implementation of the ntuplizer, a first version can be found here https://github.com/gnomeosaurus/Analyzers/blob/AODanalyzer/AODAnalyzer/plugins/AODAnalyzer.cc
The difference is mainly in the choice of variables and the adjoint of LumiScalers to access inst lumi and PU.

This code was used in the 2016 approach to ML4DQM-DC, at the time of writing, a different approach has been chosen, so this code is currently obsolete. However is kept in the repository for reference.
